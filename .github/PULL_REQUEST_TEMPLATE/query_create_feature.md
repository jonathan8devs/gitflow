# Prerequisites for adding new features

Basically, a few conditions must be checked to ensure that the deployments work and the internal process is adhered to.
- [ ] **Your branch starts with `feature/`?** Not? Then rename it. No other naming is accepted by the workflows!
- [ ] **Meaningful branch name?** Not? Then please rename your branch first!
- [ ] **Your feature branch is created from the `dev` branch?** Not? Then make sure that the dev is pulled into your branch!
- [ ] **PR is from the feature branch to the dev branch?** Not? Make sure the PR is correct from Feature to Dev!
